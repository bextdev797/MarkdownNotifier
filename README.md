## How to use MarkdownNotifier

Step 1. Learn Markdown: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax">How to use Markdown by Github</a>

Step 2. In Title Type Anything but as long as it is in Markdown. ## (title) (heading), ** title ** (bold) or * title * (italic). But for me i will recommend using ## (title).

Step 3. In Message Type Anything too but as long as it is in Markdown. ## (title) (heading), ** title ** (bold) or * title * (italic). But for me i will recommend you to use ** title ** or * title *. *No Spaces.
