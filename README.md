## MarkdownNotifier

An App Inventor 2 extension created using Rush.

## How to use MarkdownNotifier

Step 1. In Title Type Anything but as long as it is in Markdown. ## (title) (heading), ** title ** (bold) or * title * (italic). But for me i will recommend using ## (title).

Step 2. In Message Type Anything too but as long as it is in Markdown. ## (title) (heading), ** title ** (bold) or * title * (italic). But for me i will recommend you to use ** title ** or * title *.
